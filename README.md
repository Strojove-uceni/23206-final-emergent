# EMERGENT: barcodE iMage EnhanceR usinG dEep Neural neTworks

## Authors: 
 - Aleksej Gaj

## Task: 
build and implement NN that will preprocess photos of damaged barcodes and enhance them to be readable by common methods.
```
photo of damaged barcode -> (NN) -> enhanced photo -> (existing barcode reader) -> the code
```

In case of low success redesign the barcode scanner using NN.
```
photo of damaged barcode -> (NN) -> the code
```

## Notes
"Damaged barcode" = poorly readable barcode due to:
 - dirt
 - water droplets
 - glossy surface
 - curvy surface (ex. rounded bottle, bent package ...)
 - blurry photo
 - etc.
